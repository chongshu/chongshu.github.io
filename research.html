   5. "Does Proxy Advice Allow Funds to Cast Informed Votes?" June 2021

  <br/> This paper estimates to what extent proxy advice allows funds to vote as if they were informed. A fund’s vote is classified as “informed“ if the fund accessed the company’s proxy statement from the SEC’s Edgar website prior to voting. A fund’s proxy advisor, if any, is identified from the format of its Form N-PX filing. Our main finding, for the period 2004-2017, is that proxy advice did not result in funds voting as if they were informed – more often than not it pushed them in the opposite direction – and this distorting effect was particularly noticeable for ISS. The finding is robust to several strategies designed to control for endogeneity of acquiring information and seeking proxy advice, including fixed effects and instrumental variables. We also show that advice distorted votes toward policies favored by socially responsible investment (SRI) funds, and provide suggestive evidence consistent with the idea that proxy advisors slanted their recommendations toward the preferences of SRI funds because of pressure from activists.

  <br/> Mutual funds rely on recommendations from proxy advisors when voting in corporate elections. Proxy advisors’ influence has been a source of controversy, but it is difficult to study because information linking funds to their advisors is not publicly available. A key innovation of this paper is to show how fund-advisor links can be inferred from previously unnoticed features of a fund’s SEC filings. Using this method to infer links, I establish several novel facts about the proxy advisory industry. During 2007-2017, the market share of the two largest proxy advisory firms has declined slightly from 96.5 percent to 91 percent, with Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) controlling 63 percent of the market and Glass Lewis 28 percent in the most recent year. A large fraction of ISS customers appear to have robo-voted – followed ISS’s recommendations in over 99.9 percent of contentious proposals – rising from 5 percent in 2007 to 23 percent in 2017, while almost none of Glass Lewis’ customers have robo-voted. Negative recommendations from ISS or Glass Lewis reduce their customers’ votes by over 20 percent in director elections and say-on-pay proposals. Finally, proxy advisors cater to investors’ preferences, adjusting their recommendations to align with fund preferences independent of whether those adjustments lead to recommendations that maximize firm value.

<br/>Most research on financial systemic stability assumes an economy in which banks are subject to exogenous shocks, but in practice, banks choose their exposure to risk. This paper studies the determinants of this endogenous risk exposure when banks are connected in a financial network. I show that there exists a network risk-taking externality: connected banks’ choices of risk exposure are strategically complementary. Banks in financial networks, particularly densely connected ones, endogenously expose to greater risks. Furthermore, they choose correlated risks, aggravating the systemic fragility. Banks, however, do have incentives to form networks to protect their charter values. The theory yields several novel perspectives on policy debates.

  2. "A Theory of Proxy Advice when Investors Have Social Goals" with John G. Matsusaka, October 2020  <span style="color:#9051b8">&nbsp; (Submitted) </span>

<br/> This paper studies the conditions under which the proxy advice market helps and hinders corporate governance. A key assumption is that investors are heterogeneous, with some focusing only on returns while others also have nonpecuniary goals, such as environmental sustainability and protection of human rights. Proxy advisory firms compete for business by choosing a scale of production, price, and “slant” of advice. Heterogeneous demand creates pressure for the market to offer an array of advice, but there is a countervailing force: when demand is sufficiently large, suppliers adopt a “platform” technology and consolidate into a natural monopoly. Under conditions that seem empirically relevant, the platform monopolist slants its advice toward the preferences of investors with non-value-maximizing goals, thereby steering corporate elections away from value maximization. We characterize the conditions under which the proxy advice market succeeds and fails, discuss policy reforms that would help it succeed, and develop normative principles for assessing proxy advice when value maximization is not the sole objective of investors.

 1. "Rational Apathy: The Curse of Shareholder Empowerment in Uncontested Board Elections", January 2020

<br/> In contrast to popular belief, this paper shows that there does not exist an unambiguous positive relationship between an unbiased shareholder’s voting power and the quality of corporate governance. I utilize a 2010 NYSE policy change that increased shareholders’ voting power in uncontested board elections, and, to establish the causality, I take advantage of the exogenous election cycles for director elections. I find that an increase in individual shareholder’s voting power will worsen some measures of corporate governance (CEO’s pay-performance sensitivity and probability of removing poison pills). I show that this is due to shareholders’ decreased participation in both the sponsorship of governance proposals and active voting in annual meetings. I argue that the negative relationship between shareholders’ voting power and their participation is due to a free-rider problem in the collective action.

 <strong>1. "Banking Competition Revisited: Shadow Banks v.s. Commercial Banks", 2017</strong><br/>

<br/>In this paper, I first propose a novel and under-studied deposit competition from shadow banking sector that induces traditional commercial banks to offer higher deposit rates and hold riskier portfolios. The mechanism is through increased bankruptcy likelihood from higher deposit rates and it exacerbates the moral hazard problem. Then I show that through this channel of deposit competition, government could regulate both commercial banks’ and shadow banks’ risk by either a deposit ceiling regulation or an equity ratio requirement, even though shadow banks are not directly regulated. A panel data from 1987 to 2015 of 63 countries’ 1811 banks confirm that higher deposit rates by shadow banks will cause commercial banks to increase their deposit rates and risk portfolios, especially in countries with generous deposit insurance, loose banking regulation, or weak supervisor power.

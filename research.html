 <strong>"Rational Apathy: The Curse of Shareholder Empowerment in Uncontested Board Elections"</strong >

<br/>In contrast to popular belief, this paper shows that there does not exist an unambiguous positive relation between shareholders’ voting power and the quality of corporate governance. I utilize a 2010 SEC policy change that increased shareholders’ voting power in uncontested board elections, and, to establish the causality, I take advantage of the exogenous election cycles for director elections. I find that shareholders’ voting power will worsen some measures of corporate governance (CEO pay-performance sensitivity and probability of removing poison pills). I show that this is due to shareholders’ decreased participation in either the sponsorship of governance proposals and active voting in annual meetings. I argue that the negative relation between shareholders’ voting power and their participation is due to a free-rider problem.

<br/>Most research on financial systemic stability assumes an economy in which banks are subject to exogenous shocks, but in practice, banks choose their exposure to risk. This paper studies the determinants of this endogenous risk exposure when banks are connected in a financial network. I first show that there exists a network risk-taking externality: connected banks’ choices of risk exposure are strategically complementary. Banks in financial networks, particularly densely connected ones, endogenously expose to greater risks. Furthermore, due to this externality, connected banks choose to correlate their risk exposure, aggravating the systemic fragility. The deposit insurance scheme is crucial to this risk-taking externality. For policy implications, I show that (i) a network-adjusted capital regulation, (ii) a transparency policy, or (iii) a government bailout can alleviate the risk-taking externality and hence reduce banks’ equilibrium risk exposure.

 <strong>"Banking Competition Revisited: Shadow Banks v.s. Commercial Banks", 2017</strong><br/>

<br/>In this paper, I first propose a novel and under-studied deposit competition from shadow banking sector that induces traditional commercial banks to offer higher deposit rates and hold riskier portfolios. The mechanism is through increased bankruptcy likelihood from higher deposit rates and it exacerbates the moral hazard problem. Then I show that through this channel of deposit competition, government could regulate both commercial banks’ and shadow banks’ risk by either a deposit ceiling regulation or an equity ratio requirement, even though shadow banks are not directly regulated. A panel data from 1987 to 2015 of 63 countries’ 1811 banks confirm that higher deposit rates by shadow banks will cause commercial banks to increase their deposit rates and risk portfolios, especially in countries with generous deposit insurance, loose banking regulation, or weak supervisor power.

<br/> This paper documents the evolving proxy advisory industry, proxy advisors’ influences, and their incentives. Using an innovative method, I identify investors’ subscriptions of proxy advice. During 2007-2017, the industry has become less concentrated. As of 2017, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) controls 63% of the market for mutual funds in the U.S., and Glass Lewis controls 28% of the market. Both ISS and Glass Lewis have strong influences and can respectively sway 21% and 22% of their customers’ votes. Furthermore, I show that proxy advisors cater to investors’ preferences. Such catering departs from value maximization and can decrease underlying firms’ value.

<br/>Most research on financial systemic stability assumes an economy in which banks are subject to exogenous shocks, but in practice, banks choose their exposure to risk. This paper studies the determinants of this endogenous risk exposure when banks are connected in a financial network. I show that there exists a network risk-taking externality: connected banks’ choices of risk exposure are strategically complementary. Banks in financial networks, particularly densely connected ones, endogenously expose to greater risks. Furthermore, they choose correlated risks, aggravating the systemic fragility. Banks, however, do have incentives to form networks to protect their charter values. The theory yields several novel perspectives on policy debates.

  <strong>3. "A Theory of the Proxy Advice Market when Investors Have Social Goals" with John G. Matsusaka, March 2020</strong >  <span style="color:grey">&nbsp; (Submitted) </span>

<br/> This paper studies the conditions under which the proxy advice market helps and hinders corporate governance. A key assumption is that investors are heterogeneous, with some focusing only on returns while others also have nonpecuniary goals, such as environmental sustainability and protection of human rights. Proxy advisory firms compete for business by choosing a scale of production, price, and “slant” of advice. Heterogeneous demand creates pressure for the market to offer an array of advice, but there is a countervailing force: when demand is sufficiently large, suppliers adopt a “platform” technology and consolidate into a natural monopoly. Under conditions that seem empirically relevant, the platform monopolist slants its advice toward the preferences of investors with non-value-maximizing goals, thereby steering corporate elections away from value maximization. We characterize the conditions under which the proxy advice market succeeds and fails, discuss policy reforms that would help it succeed, and develop normative principles for assessing proxy advice when value maximization is not the sole objective of investors.

 <strong>2. "Rational Apathy: The Curse of Shareholder Empowerment in Uncontested Board Elections", January 2020</strong >

<br/> In contrast to popular belief, this paper shows that there does not exist an unambiguous positive relationship between an unbiased shareholder’s voting power and the quality of corporate governance. I utilize a 2010 NYSE policy change that increased shareholders’ voting power in uncontested board elections, and, to establish the causality, I take advantage of the exogenous election cycles for director elections. I find that an increase in individual shareholder’s voting power will worsen some measures of corporate governance (CEO’s pay-performance sensitivity and probability of removing poison pills). I show that this is due to shareholders’ decreased participation in both the sponsorship of governance proposals and active voting in annual meetings. I argue that the negative relationship between shareholders’ voting power and their participation is due to a free-rider problem in the collective action.

<br/>In this paper, I first propose a novel and under-studied deposit competition from shadow banking sector that induces traditional commercial banks to offer higher deposit rates and hold riskier portfolios. The mechanism is through increased bankruptcy likelihood from higher deposit rates and it exacerbates the moral hazard problem. Then I show that through this channel of deposit competition, government could regulate both commercial banks’ and shadow banks’ risk by either a deposit ceiling regulation or an equity ratio requirement, even though shadow banks are not directly regulated. A panel data from 1987 to 2015 of 63 countries’ 1811 banks confirm that higher deposit rates by shadow banks will cause commercial banks to increase their deposit rates and risk portfolios, especially in countries with generous deposit insurance, loose banking regulation, or weak supervisor power.

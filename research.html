<br/> This paper documents the evolving proxy advice industry and its growing influence on investors’ votes. Using an innovative method, I identify mutual funds’ purchases of proxy advice. As of 2017, ISS controls 63% of the market for mutual funds in the U.S. and Glass Lewis controls 28% of the market. Over the years, the industry has become less concentrated: in 2007, ISS controlled 74% of the market. However, ISS’s one-size-fits-all recommendation has a strong and growing influence over its customers’ votes. From 2006 to 2017, the fraction of ISS’s customers who robo-vote grows from 12% to 23%. The growing influence of ISS is manifested in director elections, say-on-pay proposals, and other shareholder-sponsored proposals.

  <strong>4. "A Theory of the Proxy Advice Market when Investors Have Social Goals" with John G. Matsusaka, 2020</strong >

<br/> This paper develops a theory of the proxy advice market when some investors have nonpecuniary goals such as environmental sustainability and protection of human rights. We develop a model in which advisory firms choose their production technologies and compete for the business of investors with heterogenous preferences over returns and social goals. When the market for advice is small, the industry equilibrium consists of small “boutique” firms that provide customized advice to each investment fund, and voting outcomes reflect the distribution of investor preferences. When the market is large, the industry reduces to a single advisory firm using a platform technology, the firm’s advice is slanted toward the preferences of funds with non-value-maximizing goals, and voting outcomes overrepresent the preferences of activist funds. We discuss normative principles for assessing proxy advice when value maximization is not the sole objective of investors.

 <strong>3. "Rational Apathy: The Curse of Shareholder Empowerment in Uncontested Board Elections", 2019</strong >

<br/> In contrast to popular belief, this paper shows that there does not exist an unambiguous positive relationship between an unbiased shareholder’s voting power and the quality of corporate governance. I utilize a 2010 NYSE policy change that increased shareholders’ voting power in uncontested board elections, and, to establish the causality, I take advantage of the exogenous election cycles for director elections. I find that an increase in individual shareholder’s voting power will worsen some measures of corporate governance (CEO’s pay-performance sensitivity and probability of removing poison pills). I show that this is due to shareholders’ decreased participation in both the sponsorship of governance proposals and active voting in annual meetings. I argue that the negative relationship between shareholders’ voting power and their participation is due to a free-rider problem in the collective action.

<br/>Most research on financial systemic stability assumes an economy in which banks are subject to exogenous shocks, but in practice, banks choose their exposure to risk. This paper studies the determinants of this endogenous risk exposure when banks are connected in a financial network. I first show that there exists a network risk-taking externality: connected banks’ choices of risk exposure are strategically complementary. Banks in financial networks, particularly densely connected ones, endogenously expose to greater risks. Furthermore, due to this externality, connected banks choose to correlate their risk exposure, aggravating the systemic fragility. The deposit insurance scheme is crucial to this risk-taking externality. For policy implications, I show that (i) a network-adjusted capital regulation, (ii) a transparency policy, or (iii) a government bailout can alleviate the risk-taking externality and hence reduce banks’ equilibrium risk exposure.

<br/>In this paper, I first propose a novel and under-studied deposit competition from shadow banking sector that induces traditional commercial banks to offer higher deposit rates and hold riskier portfolios. The mechanism is through increased bankruptcy likelihood from higher deposit rates and it exacerbates the moral hazard problem. Then I show that through this channel of deposit competition, government could regulate both commercial banks’ and shadow banks’ risk by either a deposit ceiling regulation or an equity ratio requirement, even though shadow banks are not directly regulated. A panel data from 1987 to 2015 of 63 countries’ 1811 banks confirm that higher deposit rates by shadow banks will cause commercial banks to increase their deposit rates and risk portfolios, especially in countries with generous deposit insurance, loose banking regulation, or weak supervisor power.

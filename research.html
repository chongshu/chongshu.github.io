  <br/> This paper develops two new methods to infer a mutual fund’s proxy advisors from SEC filings. It then applies these methods to characterize features of the proxy advice industry from 2007 to 2021: (i) As of 2021, ISS and Glass Lewis collectively control approximately 90 percent of the market. During this period, the market share of ISS remains stable, while that of Glass Lewis has increased. (ii) When a proxy advisor issues a recommendation opposing management, its customers are approximately 20 percentage points more likely to also oppose management compared to other investors. (iii) Funds that subscribe to both proxy advisors tend to vote more similarly to the recommendations of the advisor whose voting platform they use. (iv) Proxy advisors often change their advisory stance when investors disagree with their previous advice. I offer suggestive evidence that this adaptation reflects both learning from informed investors and a desire by proxy advisors to align with the preferences of their customers.

  <br/> This paper investigates if green investors can influence corporate greenhouse gas emissions through capital markets, and if so, whether they have a bigger effect by divesting their stock and limiting polluters’ access to capital, or by acquiring polluters’ stock and engaging with management. We focus on public pension funds, classifying them as green or nongreen based on which political party controlled the fund. To isolate the causal effects of green ownership, we use exogenous variation caused by state-level politics that shifted control of the funds, and portfolio rebalancing in response to returns on non-equity investment. Our main finding is that companies reduced their greenhouse gas emissions when stock ownership by green funds increased and did not alter their emissions when ownership by nongreen funds changed. Other evidence based on activist funds, voting, and shareholder proposals suggests that ownership mattered because of active engagement by green investors and not simply because management adapted proactively to changing shareholder preferences. We do not find that companies with green investors were more likely to sell off their high-emission facilities (greenwashing). Overall, our findings suggest that (a) corporate managers respond to the environmental preferences of their investors; (b) divestment of polluting companies may lead to greater emissions; and (c) private markets may be able to address environmental challenges independent of government regulation.

  <br/> We develop a novel measure of political slant in research to examine whether political ideology influences the content and use of academic research. Our measure examines the frequency of citations from think tanks with different political ideologies and allows us to examine both the supply and demand for research. We find that research in Economics and Political Science displays a liberal slant, while Finance and Accounting research exhibits a conservative slant, and these differences cannot be accounted for by variations in research topics. We also find that the ideological slant of researchers is positively correlated with that of their Ph.D. institution and research conducted outside universities appears to cater more to the political party of the current President. Finally, political donations data confirms that the ideological slant we measure based on think tank citations aligns with the political values of researchers. Our findings have important implications for the structure of research funding.

   3. "Does Proxy Advice Allow Funds to Cast Informed Votes?" with John G. Matsusaka, 2022

  <br/> This paper estimates to what extent proxy advice allows funds to vote as if they were informed. A fund’s vote is classified as “informed“ if the fund accessed the company’s proxy statement from the SEC’s Edgar website prior to voting. A fund’s proxy advisor, if any, is identified from the format of its Form N-PX filing. Our main finding, for the period 2004-2017, is that proxy advice did not result in funds voting as if they were informed – more often than not it pushed them in the opposite direction – and this distorting effect was particularly noticeable for ISS. The finding is robust to several strategies designed to control for endogeneity of acquiring information and seeking proxy advice, including fixed effects and instrumental variables. We also show that advice distorted votes toward policies favored by socially responsible investment (SRI) funds, and provide suggestive evidence consistent with the idea that proxy advisors slanted their recommendations toward the preferences of SRI funds because of pressure from activists.

<br/>Most research on systemic stability assumes an economy in which banks are subject to exogenous shocks. However, in practice, banks choose their exposure to risk. I show that there exists a network risk-taking externality: the risk exposure choices made by connected banks are strategically complementary. Banks within financial networks, especially densely connected ones, become endogenously exposed to excessive risks. Moreover, when the threat of losing bank charters is sufficiently low, they tend to choose highly correlated risks. The theory offers several novel perspectives on policy debates. For example, the theory suggests that limiting a government bailout to interbank exposures can effectively reduce endogenous systemic risk.

<br/> This paper studies the conditions under which the proxy advice market helps and hinders corporate governance. A key assumption is that investors are heterogeneous, with some focusing only on returns while others also have nonpecuniary goals, such as environmental sustainability and protection of human rights. Proxy advisory firms compete for business by choosing a scale of production, price, and “slant” of advice. Heterogeneous demand creates pressure for the market to offer an array of advice, but there is a countervailing force: when demand is sufficiently large, suppliers adopt a “platform” technology and consolidate into a natural monopoly. Under conditions that seem empirically relevant, the platform monopolist slants its advice toward the preferences of investors with non-value-maximizing goals, thereby steering corporate elections away from value maximization. We characterize the conditions under which the proxy advice market succeeds and fails, discuss policy reforms that would help it succeed, and develop normative principles for assessing proxy advice when value maximization is not the sole objective of investors.

<br/>In this paper, I first propose a novel and under-studied deposit competition from shadow banking sector that induces traditional commercial banks to offer higher deposit rates and hold riskier portfolios. The mechanism is through increased bankruptcy likelihood from higher deposit rates and it exacerbates the moral hazard problem. Then I show that through this channel of deposit competition, government could regulate both commercial banks’ and shadow banks’ risk by either a deposit ceiling regulation or an equity ratio requirement, even though shadow banks are not directly regulated. A panel data from 1987 to 2015 of 63 countries’ 1811 banks confirm that higher deposit rates by shadow banks will cause commercial banks to increase their deposit rates and risk portfolios, especially in countries with generous deposit insurance, loose banking regulation, or weak supervisor power.
